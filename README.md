# PCI-DSS-compliance
This project uses supervised machine learning models, including Random Forest and ensemble methods, to detect credit card fraud while ensuring PCI-DSS compliance. By applying SMOTE oversampling and tuning probability thresholds, it achieved an F1 score of up to 0.88, effectively handling imbalanced data.

Conclusion: Anomaly detection algorthm has provided decent results with F1-score of 83. We can improve recall & thus f1-score further by deriving new features based on the business knowledge. Since the features are transformed from PCA output, we couldn't understand their purpose and do feature engineering here.
